### Test coverage - Overview

Test coverage reports and test execution reports are important metrics in assessing the quality of your code. Test coverage reports tell you what percentage of your code is covered by your test cases. 
Test execution reports tell you which tests have been run and their results.

* SonarCloud itself does not calculate coverage. To include coverage results in your analysis, you must set up a third-party coverage tool and configure SonarCloud to import the results produced by that tool (see below). 
This feature is only available for CI-based analysis. It is not available for automatic analysis.
